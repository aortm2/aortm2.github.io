					<p>PASSAGE I</p>
					<p>Dragonfly</p>
				</div>
				<div class="view">
					<p>
						The nature trail is six feet wide and seven miles long. It slithers through the forest like a <span class="line mark"><span class="num">1</span>snake curving, and bending</span> along the banks of the river.
					</p>
					<p>
						The county cleared this <span class="line mark"><span class="num">2</span>path and paved</span> it with packed gravel, so <span class="line mark"><span class="num">3</span>they</span> would have a peaceful place to hike and bike.
					</p>
					<p>
						I ride this trail nearly every <span class="line mark"><span class="num">4</span>day—not on a bike,</span> but on “Luigi.” That’s the nickname I gave my motorized wheelchair.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="blank"><span class="num">5</span></span>Today, Luigi’s battery is fully <span class="line mark"><span class="num">6</span>charged,</span> I know I can go all the way to the end of the trail and back. But I always carry a cell phone on me just in case.
					</p>
					<p>
						Luigi’s motor <span class="line mark"><span class="num">7</span>moves slowly</span> as we venture along the trail. I can hear the gravel quietly crunching beneath
					</p>
					<p>
						Luigi’s rubber wheels. <span class="line mark"><span class="num">8</span>I hear</span> the songs of cardinals in the trees and the clamor of crickets in the grasses. I hear the murmur of water slipping over -smoothed rocks. <span class="line mark"><span class="num">9</span>It is</span> September, and some of the trees are starting to blush red and orange at their tips. The wind ruffles my hair and chills my face as I bounce <span class="line mark"><span class="num">10</span>gently, along</span> in my padded chair.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="line mark"><span class="num">11</span>Bicyclists streak past</span> in a blur of color and a cloud of <span class="line mark"><span class="num">12</span>dust</span> I don’t understand their hurry. Luigi can go fast, but I like to ride slowly, to see like a  dragonfly. I want to see everything that has changed, grown, bloomed, or died since yesterday. Today I notice that a spider has woven a web between some honeysuckle bushes by the bridge. I see that the bank of vibrant yellow black-eyed Susans by the barbed wire fence is starting to dry and fade away. I spend an <span class="line mark"><span class="num">13</span>hour; looking</span> and listening and learning.
					</p>
					<p>
						And now my ride is finished for today. I leave the trail and come out into the open, manicured park at the <span class="line mark"><span class="num">14</span>trails</span> end. There, my older brother helps me out of my chair and into his waiting van. He puts Luigi in the back, and I return to the world of pavement, streetlights, and traffic. But in my mind, I am still gliding through the forest. I am like the water, flowing over ancient stones. Inside, I am still a dragonfly.
