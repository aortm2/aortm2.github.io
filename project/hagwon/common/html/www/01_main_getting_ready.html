 					  <p>We value student-empowerment, diligence, and perseverance. Because education is a life-long learning process, we guide students to understand that there are no limits in learning. 99% percentile results are not what we are all about, but they are mere reflections of what our students have produced by discovering potentials and pushing their own limits.</p>

				<div class="txt_ar">
					<div class="txt_box">
						<p>Since 2005, we’ve been the most trusted institution for test prep in Seoul. Our philosophy is to empower students of all backgrounds to develop skills they need to thrive in the world of academia, a stepping stone to become self-sufficient learners. It doesn’t matter where you’re from or how far behind you may think you are—our team of committed instructors have helped students from all over the world, and the results speak for themselves.</p>
						<p>Our students have been accepted into some of the most prestigious institutions in the world: Harvard University, Brown University, MIT, Caltech, King’s College London, and The United States Air Force Academy to name a few.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="txt_box">
						<p>Hagwons, or Korean “cram Schools,” have a degree of notoriety for their rigor and high standards for performance. Currently, approximately 77% of all South Korean students, some starting as young as pre-kindergarten, attend hagwons. As such, South Korea consistently ranks in the top 5 countries in the world in terms of academic standards.</p>
						<p>We believe that education is something that everyone should have the equal opportunity to partake in. We’ve steered away from some of the notorious rigidness associated with hagwons, without sacrificing any of the results. Every student will always be welcome.</p>
